# Differential Calculus in One Variable

**Differential Calculus in one variable** is the study of how functions of a single variable change locally. This area of mathematics allows for the analysis of the **rate of change** of a function at a point, through the concept of the **derivative**.

The derivative measures the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph and provides fundamental information about the function's behavior, such as:
- growth or decrease (monotonicity)
- local maximum and minimum points
- concavity and convexity
- local approximations using Taylor polynomials

Differential calculus is an essential tool for **mathematics, engineering, computer science, and applied sciences**, making it possible to understand and predict the behavior of functions in practical and theoretical contexts.
